When I'm not working on coding projects, I like to unwind with a game of chess. It's a great way to keep my strategic thinking sharp and give my brain a workout. Plus, it's nice to step away from the screen for a bit and stretch my mental muscles.

Here are some highlights about me:
ðŸ”­ Current Focus: I am currently expanding my knowledge beyond the field of web development
ðŸŒ± Learning Journey: Always exploring new things!
ðŸ¥… 2024 Goals: My goal for this year is to make significant contributions to Open Source projects.
âš¡ Fun Fact: I'm also a 1900-rated chess player and a proud Linux user!
